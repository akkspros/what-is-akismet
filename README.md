## Hands-on Walkthrough

### Introduction:

Before we talk about Akismet, let's take a step back and talk about spam. If you have an email address, I'm sure you have received email spam. Spam, otherwise known as an unsolicited commercial message, or something you never asked for, trying to sell you something you don't need, happens in WordPress too. Comment Spam happens when a spammer posts comments to your website. These spam posts can make your website look less credible, include information that you don't want your readers to see and sometimes even cause problems with your website's SEO. In order to help fight this spam, Automattic offers a plugin/service called Akismet. Akismet describes itself as "an advanced hosted anti-spam service aimed at thwarting the underbelly of the web. It efficiently processes and analyzes masses of data from millions of sites and communities in real time".

### Installing Akismet:

Akismet is installed by default with WordPress, but if you do not see it in your plugin list, follow these steps to install it:

1.  Click on Plugins.
2.  Click on Add New.
3.  Type "Akismet" in the Search Plugins box.
4.  Click on the Install Now button.

### Activating Akismet and obtaining an API key:

6.  Click the "I already have a WordPress.com account" and then select the Approve Button to give Akismet permission to log in to your WordPress.com account. OR If you do not have a WordPress.com account, enter an email, username and password to establish your WordPress.com account.
7.  Once you log in, you will need to select which level of service you'd like to use and enter your payment information. Akismet offers a "name your price" offer for personal blogs along with several paid options that provide additional features for an additional price.
8.  After your payment is processed, you will receive your API key on the screen and a copy will be emailed to you.
